Unit Tests for Icecream
=====================

In this directory are unit tests for Icecream.

Unit tests check functionality by creating small binaries that test
internal functionality (e.g. functions that analyze arguments). Unit tests
are faster than actually testing Icecream binaries, but some tests
may be difficult or impossible to implement here.
